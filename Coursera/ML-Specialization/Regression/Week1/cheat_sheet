Simple regression: linear regression with one input
y = w0 + w1*x

(w0, w1) - regression coefficients

Quality metric
  Residual sum of squares (RSS)
  RSS(w0,w1) = sum((yi - (w0 + w1*xi))^2), yi -> target
  Concave function

Convergence criteria: partial derivative < epsilon

Partial derivate wrt w0 = -2*sum(yi - (w0 + w1*xi))
Partial derivate wrt w1 = -2*sum(yi - (w0 + w1*xi)*xi)

Method 1: Closed form solution (by setting the gradiet equal to 0)
w0' = sum(yi)/N - avg(w1)*sum(xi)/N
      avg house   avg     avg sq ft
      price       estimate
                  of slope

w1' = (sum(yi*xi) - sum(yi)*sum(xi)/N) / (sum(xi^2) - sum(xi)*sum(yi)/N)

Method 2: Gradient descent
w' <- w - step_size*partial_derivative

- Generally harder to solve method 1
- In case of method 2, need to choose step size and convergence
