Linear classifiers: output is weighted sum of inputs

Logistic regression
  One of the most common linear classifiers
  Apart from the output class, probability that it belongs to the class is also computed

score = w'h(x)
sigmoid(score) = 1 / (1 + exp(-score))
  sigmoid transforms x (-inf, +inf) to [0,1]

Logistic regression model:
  P(y=+1 | xi,w) = sigmoid(score(xi))
                 = 1 / (1 + exp(-w'h(xi)))

one-hot encoding: encoding catergories as numeric features

Multi-class classification: one vs all
  Each class will have its own coefficients
