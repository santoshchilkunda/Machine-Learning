When I called them they said the picnic spots are filling out fast. There is only spot left which is by the lake. It can accommodate 35-50 people and will cost around $180. I don't know this particular spot but we can play Frisbee and ball I think. We can also get a whiteboard and some board games. 

Regarding food, we can get a couple of portable bbq grills and patties along with chips and drink. Apart from that, if everyone can get something for themselves we won't starve to death.

If this has to work out, we need to book it soon. Please let me know by tomorrow noon.

If you have some other park in mind, please enquire before suggesting. And if I have missed out someone feel free to add them.
